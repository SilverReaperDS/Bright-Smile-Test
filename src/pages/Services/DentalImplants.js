          Worried About Your Missing Teeth?
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          As we age, our teeth naturally wear down. Sometimes this leads to tooth loss. Other times, disease or decay requires removal. Many people lose teeth — it’s nothing to be ashamed of.
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          But missing teeth can cause more than embarrassment. They can lead to:
        </Typography>
        <List sx={{ listStyleType: 'disc', pl: 3 }}>
          {[
            'Difficulty maintaining oral hygiene',
            'Jawbone shrinkage',
            'Lower self-esteem',
            'Speech difficulties',
            'Eating challenges and limited diet',

            </ListItem>
          ))}
        </List>
        <Typography paragraph>
          Left untreated, these issues can lead to more tooth loss and even systemic health problems. Our highly trained dentists in Nablus are here to help with advanced dental implant solutions.

          Why Choose Dental Implants?
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          Dental implants are the most durable and natural-feeling tooth replacement available. Unlike traditional restorations that only replace the visible part of the tooth, implants also restore the root.
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          Because implants are anchored into your jawbone, they help preserve bone density and prevent your jaw from shrinking. They also stop neighboring teeth from shifting and support your overall oral health.
        </Typography>
